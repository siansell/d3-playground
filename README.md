# d3 training

Working through https://livebook.manning.com/book/d3js-in-action-third-edition

Noticed this third edition is not complete yet! So have reached end of chapter 5 and reverted to second edition.

- The d3 world/community is *heavily* dependent on one person (Mike Bostock). This doesn't seem  particularly healthy to me. How is the community organised and how are decisions on the d3 project direction taken?
